From: Mark Grimm

I've been hunting for a new action RPG game to play. Since this is perhaps my favorite genre, I have at least meddled with most popular action-RPG's. My transition to this genre was provoked almost entirely by Blizzard's Diablo. Here is my list:

For simplicity's sake, the games that I have **NOT** played are in **bold**.

PC

Baldur's Gate  
**Baldur's Gate II**  
Diablo  
Diablo II  
Diablo II - Lord of Destruction  
Dungeon Siege  
Dungeon Siege - Legends of Aranna  
Dungeon Siege 2  
Dungeon Siege 2 - Broken World  
Neverwinter Nights + Expansions  
Sacred  
Sacred - Underworld  
Titan Quest

XBOXâ„¢

Baldur's Gate - Dark Alliance  
Baldur's Gate - Dark Alliance II  
Dungeons and Dragons: Heroes  
Fabl  
**Fable - The Lost Chapters  
**X-Men Legends II

There is my current list. If you have any action - RPG recommendations or warnings, please let me know.
